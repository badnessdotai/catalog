Twitch streamer QTCinderella has been dealing with ongoing sexual harassment following the circulation of non-consensual, AI-generated pornographic images of her and other female streamers.

Her harassment has been “relentless,” with abusive messages and images being sent to her directly.

QTCinderella explained that the experience has left her feeling violated and has resurfaced past traumas.
