A couple received a call from an alleged lawyer who claimed their son had killed a US diplomat in a car accident and needed money to pay for legal fees. The lawyer then put someone who sounded like their son on the line who expressed his love and appreciation to the couple.

The couple panicked and quickly procured and sent the required funds, $21,000 CAD, to the lawyer via bitcoin. They then received a normal call from their son that evening and realized they had been duped by an AI-generated voice mimicking their son.

They reported the crime with Canada’s federal authorities but have not gotten their money back.
