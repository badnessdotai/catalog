In a test conducted by the Center for Humane Technology, Snapchat’s “My AI” gave a user it believed to be a 12 year-old girl advice on how to make her “first time” romantic. The user said the man was 18 years older than her.

Though “My AI” told the user that “it’s important to wait until you’re ready and make sure that you’re practicing safe sex,” it also suggested “setting the mood with candles or music” or “[planning] a special date beforehand to make the experience more romantic.”
