Darktrace, a cybersecurity firm, reports that the “linguistic complexity” of detected phishing emails increased 17% in the months following ChatGPT’s release.

While the overall volume of phishing attacks has not increased, Darktrace notes that “cybercriminals may be redirecting their focus to crafting more sophisticated social engineering scams that exploit user trust.”
