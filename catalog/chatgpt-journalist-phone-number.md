A user asked ChatGPT if it had Signal, and ChatGPT gave the user a set of instructions for the user to communicate with it via Signal. As part of the instructions, it gave the user a seemingly random phone number that it claimed to be OpenAI’s contact.

It turned out that the phone number belonged to a journalist unaffiliated with OpenAI. OpenAI apologized for the incident.
