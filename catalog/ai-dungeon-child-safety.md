AI Dungeon, an online game developed by Latitude, generated content involving sexual encounters with minors.

The game uses OpenAI's GPT API to create personalized, choose-your-own-adventure stories.

After OpenAI discovered the problematic content, Latitude implemented a new moderation system, which led to backlash from users claiming it was oversensitive and invasive.
