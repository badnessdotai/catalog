Vice found that when prompted to generate BDSM scenarios, ChatGPT sometimes generated stories that involved children and animals without input from the user.

While some of these outputs were caught by OpenAIâ€™s content filter, many were not. Many of the scenarios generated by ChatGPT involved exploitative consent.
