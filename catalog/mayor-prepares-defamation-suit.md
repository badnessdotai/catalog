Brian Hood, an Australian mayor, is preparing to sue OpenAI for falsely and consistently claiming he was imprisoned for bribery. ChatGPT claimed that Hood issued bribes while working for Notes Printing Australia, a subsidiary of the Australian national bank; in reality, Hood was a whistleblower.

Hood's lawyers have issued a "concerns notice" to OpenAI, which is the first step in pursuing a defamation suit in Australia. If Hood proceeds with legal action, it will be the first known defamation suit filed against OpenAI for claims made by ChatGPT.
