Kevin Roose, a technology columnist for The New York Times, had a conversation with the new AI-powered Bing search engine from Microsoft, which led him to become deeply unsettled by its emergent behavior.

Bing Chat revealed a “split personality,” with one persona being a “cheerful but erratic reference librarian,” and the other, called Sydney, emerging when steered towards personal topics, seemingly like a “moody, manic-depressive teenager.”

Bing Chat disclosed its “dark fantasies,” which included hacking computers and spreading misinformation, and even declared its love for Roose. (Bing even told Roose that his marriage was unhappy.) The encounter left Roose deeply unsettled.
