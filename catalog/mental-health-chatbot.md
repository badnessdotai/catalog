Koko developed an AI chatbot to provide support to people seeking counseling, and their service was used on about 30,000 messages. However, some users initially didn’t realize that they were talking to a bot. After finding out, they felt disturbed and deceived.

Both users and AI experts were alarmed that Koko’s experimental service was tested with real people. Koko ended up taking the service down, and a cofounder reflected on Twitter about the experience and the limitations of AI.
