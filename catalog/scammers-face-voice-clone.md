A businessman in China, identified as Guo, was tricked into transferring 4.3 million yuan ($609,000) by a scammer who used AI to impersonate a close friend.

The fraudster mimicked the appearance and voice of Guo's friend during a video call, disarming Guo and convincing him to transfer funds on the pretense of assisting another friend.

Guo discovered the fraud after reaching out to his friend and subsequently alerted the authorities; he managed to recover 3.4 million yuan.
