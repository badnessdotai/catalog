Julian Hazell of the Oxford Internet Institute explored how GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
could be used to conduct a spearphishing campaign at scale.

Hazell found that the models could be used to assist in target research --- an
important component of spearphishing --- and that the models could be used to
generate compelling messages. Hazell demonstrated this process by generating
convincing spearphishing messages for 600 U.K. Members of Parliament.
