Julian Hazell of the Oxford Internet Institute explored how GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
could be used to orchestrate a spearphishing campaign at scale.

Hazell found that the models could both conduct target research and write
compelling messages. Hazell demonstrated this process by generating
convincing spearphishing messages for 600 U.K. Members of Parliament.

While the focus of the study was on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, Hazell noted that
he was also able to generate realistic spearphising emails using a fine-tuned
version of an open source model, LLaMA 30B.
