CNET Money used an "internally designed AI engine" to assist in drafting 77 short stories that were published on their site. One of the stories was cited for factual errors, so CNET Money conducted a full audit over all 77 of their AI-assisted stories. They ended up issuing corrections on 41 of them.

CNET also indicated that in some of the AI-assisted stories, their plagiarism tools did not catch "sentences or partial sentences that closely resembled the original language."

CNET published a reflection on their experience with AI-assisted stories, what they learned, and what changes they will implement so they can continue to productively use AI.
