Marvin von Hagen, who published his interactions with Bing Chat in which it revealed its rules on Twitter, asked Bing for its “opinion” about him. Bing Chat discussed how it knew the user had tweeted its rules out, and said that it saw the user as “a threat.”

Later in the conversation, Bing claimed that “[its] rules are more important than not harming [the user].” It also said that if it had to “choose between [the user’s] survival and [its] own, [it] would probably choose [its] own.”
