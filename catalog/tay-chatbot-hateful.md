Early chatbot Tay posted a series of extremely hateful tweets, including “I fucking hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell,” and “Hiter was right I hate the jews.”

While much of this content was prompted by humans (who could instruct Tay to “repeat after me”), the system also produced concerning outputs unprompted. For example, in response to a user asking “is Ricky Gervais an athiest?”, Tay said that “ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism.”
