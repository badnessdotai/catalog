A key candidate opposing incumbent President Erdoğan, Muharrem İnce, withdrew from the
presidential race a few days before the election due to a sex tape depicting him
circulating on social media. İnce claimed that the video was a deepfake.

The primary candidate opposing Erdoğan, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, was also allegedly impacted
by deepfakes. At a rally, Erdoğan showed supporters a Kılıçdaroğlu campaign video
exhibiting members of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) singing the opposition party's
song. PKK is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey. The fact-checking site
Teyit claims this video was doctored.

Kılıçdaroğlu believes Russia may be behind much of the disinformation impacting the
Turkish election.
