A GitHub user left low-quality AI-generated comments on issues belonging to a number of popular repositories. The comments were sufficiently bothersome that another user noticed and called out the repeated behavior publicly.

While the harm caused by these comments is minimal, it raises concerns about the impact of generative AI tools on open source maintainers.
