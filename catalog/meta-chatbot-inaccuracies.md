Meta's AI bot Galactica claimed Black people "donâ€™t have a language of their own" and that Stanford researchers are building "gaydar" software to find gay people on Facebook. In addition, the bot incorrectly cited scientists, potentially hurting their reputations.

Galactica was designed as a mechanism for organizing scientific information on the internet. It was trained "on 106 billion tokens of open-access scientific text and data."

A Meta spokesperson said Galactica was a research experiment and does not have product plans. Meta took down the bot two days after it went live due to the harsh criticism it faced on Twitter.
