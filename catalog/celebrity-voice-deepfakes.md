Online communities used the ElevenLabs voice cloning service to impersonate celebrities and disseminate audio clips of them saying hateful comments.

For example, one audio clip featured a voice emulating Emma Watson reading a section of Mein Kampf. In another case, a voice emulating Ben Shapiro made racist comments about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

ElevenLabs put out a statement via Twitter discussing their ideas for additional safeguards after the incident, which were additional account verifications, verifying voice copyrights, and manually verifying cloning requests.
