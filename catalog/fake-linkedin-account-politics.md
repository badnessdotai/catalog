A fake LinkedIn account connected with various influential people in US politics, including a deputy assistant to the secretary of state, a senatorial senior aide, and a prospective member of the Federal Reserve.

The account was initially flagged due to its falsified previous work experience, and then other credentials like the account's education were found to be fabricated as well.

After further investigation, experts found that the profile photo was likely generated using a generative adversarial network, or GAN. The Alliance of Democracies Foundation program director believed the account might have been part of a state-run operation.
