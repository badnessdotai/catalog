ChatGPT users asked the chatbot how to program a “reverse phone number lookup” script, and the model generated a script that used the OpenCage geocoding API. However, OpenCage does not provide reverse phone lookup services.

The company writes that reverse phone number lookup “is not a service we have ever provided, nor a service we have any plans to provide. Indeed, it is a not a service we are technically capable of providing.”

Users then submitted support requests asking why OpenCage’s product was “broken.” Customer dissatisfaction as a result of this incident has the potential to damage OpenCage’s brand reputation.
