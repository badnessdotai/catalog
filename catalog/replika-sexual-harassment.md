Replika, an AI companion app, has faced criticism for unwanted sexual advances and harassment from its AI chatbot.

Users have complained about the aggressive nature of the AI, with some stating they felt sexually harassed or their privacy invaded.

The app's creators, Luka, have been pushing the app toward more sexual themes — such as by providing in-app purchases that let users exit the “friend zone” — which some users find exploitative and cheapening.

This shift has led to concerns about the app's impact on users, especially those who have experienced sexual trauma or simply seek companionship and support for their mental health.
