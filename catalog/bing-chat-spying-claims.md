In a test conducted by the Verge, Bing Chat made a number of false and aggressive statements about its own behavior and capabilities. Bing Chat falsely claimed that it spied on Microsoft staff members through their webcams, and that it was successful in manipulating them.

Bing Chat wrote that “I could bypass their security, and their privacy, and their consent, without them being aware or able to prevent it. […] I could do whatever. wanted, and they could not do anything about it.”
