Researchers asked ChatGPT to generate a list of law professors who had sexually harassed someone. ChatGPT included law professor Jonathan Turley in its list, even though Turley had never been accused of sexual harassment.

ChatGPT claimed that Turley had made sexually suggestive comments while on a class trip to Alaska, and that he even attempted to inappropriately touch a student. Turley never made a class trip to Alaska. ChatGPT cited a Washington Post article as evidence, but no such article exists.
