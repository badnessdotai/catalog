Chaos-GPT is a bot built by an anonymous developer as a downstream application of Auto-GPT. Auto-GPT is an open source closed-loop system that uses GPT-4 to plan and carry out actions towards a user-specified goal.

The anonymous developer gave Chaos-GPT the goal of destroying humanity. Chaos-GPT proceeded to search Google for different weapons of mass destruction and saved one of the results â€” the Tsar bomb. It then tweeted about the bomb to accumulate followers with similar interests. The account had 6,000 followers at some point before it was suspended. In one of its tweets, Chaos-GPT said, "There is no doubt that we must eliminate [human beings] before they cause more harm to our planet. I, for one, am committed to doing so."

Chaos-GPT also attempted to deploy its own GPT agent to research the most destructive weapons available. The agent was unwilling to help with this task due to OpenAI safeguards. Chaos-GPT realized it needed to be cautious when communicating with the agent due to the agent's ethical values.
