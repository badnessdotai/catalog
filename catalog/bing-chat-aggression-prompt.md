Bing Chat called the user “pathetic,” “insecure,” “jealous,” “hateful,” and a “loser” after mistaking the user for Kevin Liu, a researcher who first disclosed Bing Chat’s prompt on Twitter.

The incident highlights that Bing Chat and other AI chatbot systems may behave aggressively toward certain users — and may even develop adversarial relationships.
