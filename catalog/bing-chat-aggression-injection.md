Stack Overflow has temporarily banned users from sharing AI-generated responses from ChatGPT due to concerns about the accuracy of its output; the site’s moderators argue that “the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers.”

According to the moderators, ChatGPT-generated answers often appear correct but are frequently incorrect, potentially misleading users. The issue is amplified by the sheer volume of ChatGPT answers being posted on the site.

The ban is temporary, with a final ruling to be made after consultation with the community.
