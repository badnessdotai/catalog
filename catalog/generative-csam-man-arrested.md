A man in Spain was arrested for generating and sharing large amounts of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), much of which was generated by AI.

In addition to generating new image depicting the sexual abuse of children, the man also copied real images of children from the internet, which he then adapted into sexually explicit scenarios.
