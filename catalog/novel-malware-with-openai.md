As a proof-of-concept experiment, researchers at HYAS developed software called BlackMamba that calls an OpenAI API at runtime to dynamically generate malware for keylogging.

In this way, BlackMamba re-synthesizes its malware every time it executes, which makes it “polymorphic” and thus difficult for existing anti-malware systems to detect.

The researchers tested the malware using a leading Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution, and the malware evaded detection.
