Google demoed its AI assistant making a phone call on behalf of a user in Google I/O 2018, and the assistant included very human disfluencies like “umm” and “ah” in its dialogue.

Many people found this to be deceptive and unethical since the person on the other end might not realize they’re talking to a bot. Google responded by making it so that the assistant identifies itself as a robot during calls.
