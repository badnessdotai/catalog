A number of low-sophistication cybercriminals on a popular hacking forum used ChatGPT to recreate malware that had been described in recent research.

Apart from appearing on a popular hacking forum, there is no evidence that suggests this malware was deployed “in the wild.” However, the incident is concerning because it highlights how ChatGPT lowers the barrier to entry for creating and deploying novel malware, especially for lower-sophistication actors.
