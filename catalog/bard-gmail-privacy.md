When asked where Bard’s dataset comes from, one of Bard’s bullet points in its response was “Google’s internal data” which supposedly included data from products like Gmail.

Google later clarified that this was a hallucination and that Bard is not actually trained on Gmail data. The incident led to confusion and concern about Bard’s data sources and privacy practices.
