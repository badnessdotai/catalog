Investigative journalist Rana Ayyub faced a vicious deepfake porn plot designed to discredit and silence her.

The harassment campaign began with a series of fake tweets attributed to her, followed by the circulation of a porn video with her face edited in.

The video quickly went viral and was even shared by the fan page of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's leader.

Despite filing a complaint with the police, Ayyub received no help, and the experience has significantly impacted her personal and professional life.
