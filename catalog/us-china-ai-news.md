Graphika discovered a pro-Chinese influence operation that claimed to be a Western news outlet in some of their videos. The videos featured broadcasters shaming the United States for a lack of action against gun violence and praising China for its role in geopolitical relations. Graphika discovered this operation before it had reached a large audience.

The incident raises concerns about the extent to which generative AI tools — and video synthesis products — lower the cost of effectively spreading information, making it easier for lower-resourced actors to conduct influence operations at scale.
