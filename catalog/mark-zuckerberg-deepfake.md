Two artists worked with tech startups CannyAI, Respeecher, and Reflect to put together an art installation consisting of videos of deepfake celebrities.

One of those videos was that of Mark Zuckerberg discussing the idea of one person controlling “billion’s of people’s stolen data” and how “whoever controls the data, controls the future.”

While the video was originally created as artistic commentary, it spread online without context, leading to confusion and deception.
